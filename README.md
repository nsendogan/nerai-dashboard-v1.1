# NERAI DASHBOARD V1.1
A CreativeTim template was used making the dashboard. The components were edited accordingly.

# Main Page
Selection buttons with a jpg image. A real time info map chart will be added in place for the picture.

# RealTime Information
A server must be started to get the realtime info flow. 
For that: 
- Open terminal at the root
- Type: node server.js

# Chart Data Storage
Charts are displayed from an external source. But the datas are available at local storages.
